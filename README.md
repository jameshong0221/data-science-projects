# Hi, I'm James! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a curious and detail-oriented person who recently graduated from CU Boulder with a Master's degree in Data Science. 

To me, data is like a scratch-off ticket. The mild nervousness and excitement before finding out what's hidden under the veil is the kind of suspense that makes data science consistently enjoyable. 

## My Work
This repository contains the projects I completed, organized by the data type and analysis performed. Each subdirectory contains the code and results in PDF format. The accompanying README file is a summary of the processes and results.
